    <p>
      Welcome to the about me page. This game was developed by Crawsome, but as a group we decided
      to add onto this game for our Intro to Software Engineering project. For more information on what
      we did and how to play the game, please continue reading! Thank you for your support!

<p>PyRPG_Mini was an RPG game developed by crawsome. The game is made mostly in python with the help
  of SQL. While the game was developed to be a relatively simple role-playing game, we thought that
  we could make it something more. Our group for Intro to Software Engineering decided to add features
  to the game to make it more viable. In that, we decided to add several brand new characters to the game
  with all new features, all new mini games were added to create more incentive, and on top of that we
  added more usability and stability to the game by adding features like saveability and a web application
  still in production. With the help of Andrew Brown, Nour Hijazi, Anthony Mitchell, and myself
  (Caleb Austin) we hope to make this game something so much more. Please enjoy. For further
  instructions on how to play see the informational below.
